          15 million repayable over a maximum period of 20 years. The loan tenor
          which is a maximum of 20 years is subject to member’s age not

          cannot access more than 10 years of mortgage loan tenor. Members will
          be required to make equity contributions of 30%, 20% or 10% as the
          case may be. The loan amount is determined by the applicant’s
          affordability. This entails his/her income level that will enable
          repayment of the loan.
