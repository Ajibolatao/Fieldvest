          This is a compulsory saving that must be contributed by all members of
          Coopital Cooperative as a condition of membership and to access credit
          (loans) otherwise face the risk of been expelled from the society for
          non-performance. Compulsory saving is a saving that a member is
          compelled to make on a regular basis; it is a membership saving and
          must be saved on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.
        </div>
        <div class="py-2">
          The minimum monthly savings have been set at N5,000. It is the only
          type of savings that is eligible for dividend payment while other
          types of savings earn only interest. This compulsory saving is
          collected to lend to members. If members fail to save on time they
          will get penalized based on the saving policy of the society. Unless a
          member quits the society, he or she should save on a regular basis. If
          a member wants to withdraw from Coopital Cooperative, it is only under
          this condition that compulsory savings may be withdrawn. Exit from the
          Cooperative is only permitted after 12 months of joining the society.

          As the name implies, it is a voluntary saving, not for access to loans
          but for the sake of saving. These are not an obligatory part of
          accessing credit services. They are provided by both the borrowers and
          non-borrowers who can deposit or withdrawal according to their needs.
          The voluntary savings are best fit for people who don’t receive
          constant cashflow like farmers, traders and other self-employed
          persons who get incomes when they sell off their product or receive
          contract proceeds. They can make voluntary saving during harvest time,
          receipt of contract payment and transfer monthly to their compulsory
          saving accounts. Members can save the full amount for the coming
          year’s compulsory savings in advance with the society by depositing 12
          months worth of saving in a voluntary account. Following that, the
          member can give a standing order instruction to Coopital Cooperative
          for each month on the appropriate day to withdraw the amount of one
          month’s compulsory saving from the voluntary saving account and
          deposit it in the compulsory saving account. This maintains the
          fundamental function of the cooperative and allows individuals with
          seasonal incomes to be members. This ensures a regular flow of cash to
          the Coopital Cooperative society and promotes members participation.
          This kind of saving can be withdrawn at any time when the owner needs
          it. Coopital Cooperative society may or may not provide saving
          interest for this voluntary savings. Members are highly advised to
          save on voluntary saving for small capital investment into their
          businesses. All that is needed is to save towards whatever goal a
          member has set for him/herself. This type of savings may earn interest
          but not eligible for dividend payment.

          A fixed deposit is an investment and a form of savings that earns you
          a higher interest rate. This kind of savings account is where a member
          saves to meet a particular goal. It is a savings focused at achieving
          a goal e.g school fees, rent, car purchase, vacation, land
          acquisition, wedding ceremony, burial, house buying, etc. The fixed
          deposit account allows a member to deposits once and they withdraw the
          money after a period of time. The time ranges from 3 months onwards.
          This type of savings earns a higher interest rate which is varied by
          the cooperative from time to time but is not eligible for dividend
          payment.
